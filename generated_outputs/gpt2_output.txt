Write me a song 
Baby, I know you wanna be mine 
Baby...here we go again
I need all of mines
Please come here quick, please bring the coffin
Please bring the morgue with it
We dont wanna see you dead, we wont lie
God is fair and you will find him
In the heart of an un-American
How can I help you if my ethnicity isnt strong?
I mean I can help you even if my race is not strong?
If I hate you, Ill make sure your love is sweet as Sounwave
I am an African American, you are African
And I feel that every message you send is wrapped in plastic
With your hands out the window, you might catch an audible hummer
Throw the plastic back at me, like Titanic to a Haitian
My cousins relatives die before they turn us, I wonder how Im posed to respond
We was raised by wolves, were old enough
Not prepared, not to feed the hoes, not willing to wait for nothing
So there was nothing to take life
But the anticipation, wait what the hell, our familys happening over a year, we panic over nothing
I wonder when the future missed it didnt matter, let us forget what we missed
The point, we just pray for change and wait when we need change
Tables break when we got the basics and aint left over everything else
Then we hit the block and say you
The next, they say we run over, and we say we run over, now we run over over the things
If we running away from the benefits
The city and children
We run away from the hearts
We should have the streets and be safe
They dont take em and then hide behind the casket
Let us burn and look behind the cameras
Im not afraid to run right through them with fear
But we running scared of yall niggas, we run so well
Im not runnin blind when we run up and we get no
You could be scared of us, cause niggas be so innocent and innocent we never knew
Run away, run into danger while we still breathing with freedom
Run to bars but with death sentences
I was built to run away from temptation thats evil and temptations
Run away from fear but this what happened last night
When I was young and black and white
Dont let them tell you
