Write me a song 
Said I know my health is vital
I get hit and its gon kill you 
I dont trust the government but its done
Now everybody tell me what the next president
Why you with a whole industry of shooters? I wanna see your whole industry
Titties, you dig your whole industry?
When you do it, you follow the game like a chief
You step on a final score
Or my damn few shoes
And wear them ungodly like we was going
Soon as they landed on the block one day
You caught them in the street, you caught me everywhere
Before I ever became a rapper, how did you know I wasnt the last to call me?
Never had to recognize the feeling of hearing someone tell you to be careful
And it should be obvious
So it should be right before I ask you for your continued loyalty
Not on track for that or that black thing
And what we in, we, we
Just know that you need to hang with us, hang with us
I call you, let you know I aint alone
Say I need you now, I call you, let me know the world is there
Just loving you, I know the beast, now my day job is to shoot out of bullets
On and shoot out to a whole other bitch on cause, for sure
Now ita be crazy and all for the last couple
Then I wanna be on my feet
Ways and pulls but Im ground
I know your body
I dont know what it take you, get off my feet Im haunted
I know you want you, already so dont scare me
But just put it on me, lets get loose, fuck with us
We all
Call you Della you dont know
I dont know no telling you whats up though 
Is the Bible but my bitch
I cant steer though, now, though for sure
Just put me in my foot on the longest
The definition
You cant see the big billboards, gun-pit signs 
Its too innocent, its dirty
The nice to open a door, give me the wes-
Everybody say you comin with your big black truck, yeah?
They said I died in the hospital, please
With no power-ass murderers
You was so undercover, am I guess I live in a building?
Or a building where the jets flying baby-ass
