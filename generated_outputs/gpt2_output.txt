Write me a Kendrick Lamar song 
What I dont love about her, I love her 
She needs me, she needs me, she need me, she need me, she need me, she want me
I love her, I love her, I love her
I love her, I love her, I love her
So we go and we dance to God
Now let me put them two on the CD
Now let me put them two on the CD
Now let me put these two on the CD
I love her, I love her, I love her
And let us play that part
Let me put these two on the CD
Ohhh, ayy, ayy
And let the CD get the same
Ayy, let the CD get the same
Ayy, ayy, Ayy, ayy
Uh, I know youre gonna keep me on this track, I might get lost, I might get lost 
Okay, I know I got your number, I know I might get lost
I just gotta get this right in the booth, or somethin aint the answer
But I got the stamina to get me to stop
Cause Im from the grindin, Ive just got to run and get on the shit, and get it right 
Hey, ayy, ayy, ayy
Just a nigga wanna get something, nigga 
I dont even care who you gonna be on that, nigga
Uh, I just want my shit right now 
Yeah, you wanna play that part 
Just to see me on the world 
If I don’t wanna stay off my grind, I ain’t know I wanna run 
Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy
Got the stamina 
You gotta know what you wanna be
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I love a nigga, I love my girlfriend
My sweetheart, she love me, I love her 
My sweetheart, she love me, I love her, oh
I love her, oh 
I love her, I love her, I love her, oh
I love her, I love her
I love her 
I love her, I love her 
I love her, I love her 
Now lets go back and turn my mind to you
I love her, I love
