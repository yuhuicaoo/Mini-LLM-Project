Write me a Kendrick Lamar song
Tell me what you think about the new Nike Air Rattles?
I think we finally got the recipe for a great year
Aint that funkin kinda hard on you? 
Yeah, yeah, I think so
Do you have a favorite beat that you want to share with your homie
Or one that is forever your family and friends
And friends, family, and loved ones
Thank you very much for your service
Kendrick Lamar, amen
Love, lets talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for? Oh, no, it can not be everything
Get a better sense of what it is like to be depressed, anxious, or alone
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you from a different direction
Deeper in the sky, bring more of the same, but youre still in control
Astronomerically speaking, Im speeding through the speed of light
Im speeding past you like an astroid, travelling at a high speed
Like a comet, you cant see me and Pluto
You aint even know it, this is not a dream, just a metaphor for me
So I ask you to give you a space to breathe and explore
In the midst of all the madness
What if I could live in a city where crime pays the price of livin in bars and crime payin
With the ghetto children and the children of color blind? Or the deaf kids with the disabilities
Theres no justice system for these kids
Where do we go wrong? Theres a place to stay and a way to get away from it
Walking around with them blue faces and wonderin why they actin so sad
When you lookin at me then youll probably think to yourself
Maybe Im just tryna make amends
To live my life, to live it right
Cause Ive been runnin for so long
Runnin through so many obstacles
But somehow I managed to overcome
My past, now Im free
Now Im relivin moments that we never had
Hope that Im not losin focus
Let me start off the third verse
Give me fuel for the fire burnin when I yearn these lights
For the love I got in my vein
Burning up the candle thats burning bright enough to make the flame turn into a flame
Come to me, give me the light
