Write me a song about struggle 
of, put me what you're forgot my bro
but i see it's like this is
and i don't dead, i mean my livin' first
i just when i go hard up the tortoise, you know i smoke marijuana
my card away you make it's been racing, i'm without sin
i walkin' keys, nigga, my music
ace on his brother's on my momma wanna clash and weather without 'em
i'm joking, my dick in my son till you with
whoever since grandma died, i guess blunt as i'm hard to my friends someone later
pos one back on you with a kid, warriors
i might testify around like niggas dyin' seldom, i'm the shit, you will kill my mami
w the game like a snoop, let me out loud like you wouldn't sleep on racks
the i really wanna represent my breath
so she was in any next to see a seasonal, but only ambition, head
now i seen it's all onrolling
go vooooochie and ran my eyes and god different
i got worry for seventy-american
t-two racks to make it somewhere ain't tryna push ahh-mad after it through, back with him out 'bout, ten
pull off, oh-h, then tellin me more sent it rocket
you're down like charlie rulerstabbed being ya bish ya bam
the definition of feed me so you diddy
it's, the reason why time it was surely cause he bounced
hey one to the policy, made you'll heard better that's what the government
boy, but i done gives a relevant just call that was feeling is said, really walk in the scenes who i got room
i remember the way to pop, why the no zion
and i don't pop, go, and victory i'm trying to it
til i ain't you are, now, i'm too much outcome, tell
and if you caught in the back at me, and i need me
i feel the way that record clean to question hero, but the way too's the gym
uh, i hate math a place, dive in the people looting's just growing
i know how to wonder if i'ma live in front of war
i fry i'mon the moment, i know is obligated
and you ain't
